      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><b>Hello! I'm Andrea Stacy, and this is my portfolio showcasing several projects I completed during my time at Weber State University.</b><br>
        I began my academic journey at Weber in Fall 2019, enrolling directly after high school with the goal of becoming a programmer. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to connect with a diverse and inspiring community of STEM students and faculty.
        <br>Iâ€™ve been actively involved in organizations such as <i>Women in STEM</i> and the <i>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</i>, which have enriched my educational experience and professional development. Iâ€™ve also had the privilege of being mentored by Professor Nicole Anderson, whose guidance has played a significant role in shaping my path.
