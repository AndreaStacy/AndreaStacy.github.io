      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><b>Hello! I'm Andrea Stacy, and this is my portfolio showcasing several projects I completed during my time at Weber State University.</b><br>
        I began my academic journey at Weber in Fall 2019, enrolling directly after high school with the goal of becoming a programmer. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to connect with a diverse and inspiring community of STEM students and faculty.
        <br>Iâ€™ve been actively involved in organizations such as <i>Women in STEM</i> and the <i>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</i>, which have enriched my educational experience and professional development. Iâ€™ve also had the privilege of being mentored by Professor Nicole Anderson, whose guidance has played a significant role in shaping my path.

        <h3>Invoice System - C#</h3>
        <p>This project, completed for CS 3280 - Object Oriented Windows, was a group assignment to develop a Windows WPF application 
          simulating an invoice system for a fictional business. Each team member was responsible for a different page; I worked on the 
          Main page, which handled creating new invoices, adding items, viewing older invoices, and submitting the completed invoice.</p>

        <h3>Block Inspired Math Game</h3>
        <p>This project, completed for CS 3280 - Object Oriented Windows, was a short math game in wpf to mess around with making themes. 
          For mine it is based off a popular crafting game and has 10ish levels in which the user answers simple math problems to win. </p>

        <h3>Text Prediction - Jupyter Notebook</h3>
        <p>This project, completed for CS 4580 - Data Science & Algorithms, served as an introduction to text-based 
          identification using predictive algorithms. We analyzed the writing styles of multiple authors, using Principal Component 
          Analysis (PCA) to visualize 
          stylistic similarities. Various prediction models were then applied to evaluate how accurately they could identify the 
          author of a new, added book. The project was divided into two parts: a guided first phase and a more independent second phase.</p>

        <h3>Android Superhero API App</h3>
        <p>This project, completed for CS 3270 - Mobile Develop for Android, was a beginner-level Android application. The app allows users to 
          select two superheroes using data retrieved from an external API. It features a functionality that can randomly select 
          two superheroes and compare their stats to determine a hypothetical winner in a head-to-head battle. While simple in design, 
          the app serves as an introduction to core Android development concepts such as API integration, UI design, and basic 
          logic implementation.</p>
